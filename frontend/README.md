# Event Program QR SaaS  

This project is a SaaS platform that allows event organizers to upload their event programs and share them digitally via a **QR code**. Attendees can simply scan the QR code and view the event program on their phones, reducing the need for printed copies.

âœ… This way Copilot, contributors, and even potential testers immediately understand what the app is, how itâ€™s structured, and how to run it.  

Do you want me to also **set up a backend skeleton folder** (`/backend`) with a basic Express server so you donâ€™t just have frontend code sitting there? That way, your project structure matches this README exactly.
