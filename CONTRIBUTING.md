# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to get started:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
- Keep changes small and focused. Create one pull request per feature/fix.
- Run the tests locally before opening a PR (if present):

  Backend:
  ```powershell
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm test
  ```

  Frontend:
  ```powershell
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm test
  ```

- Write clear commit messages and include a brief description in your PR.
- Be patient and responsive to review feedback.

If you want to discuss a larger change first, open an issue describing the plan.
